# WayFinder-A-Recursive-Puzzle-Solver
A program that finds all solutions to a number puzzle
The goal of this project is to implement a program that finds all solutions to a number puzzle.

The puzzle uses an array of positive integers. The objective is to find a path from index zero to the last index in the array. At each step
we need to know the distance to be traveled and the direction. Each entry in the array is a number indicating the distance to be traveled
on this particular leg of the path. The player (your program) needs to decide the direction (if the move should be made to the right or to
the left).
